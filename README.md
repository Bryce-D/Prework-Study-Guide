This project is used for notes to take on the four things needed in web developing being HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It also allows the user to see the JavaScript in use by going to the Dev Tools for the website. If you no idea where to start studying first, open the Chrome DevTools by using the Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) key shortcuts on your keyboard. A console panel will open either below or on the side of the webpage in the Google Chrome Browser.
